# Algorithms HW #2-2: implementing Sorting Algorithms
- Author: Yeonjun Kim (2024-13755)
- Date: 2025-10-05
- Programmed and tested in Ubuntu 24.04 environment.

## Features
- Insert / Merge / Quick / QuickDualPivot Sorting

## How to run
- Before running the program, you should place `input.txt` in this directory. The first row in the file should contain a single integer N, the size of the array. The second row should contain N integers making the array, separated by spaces. If there is no `input.txt` or the format is wrong, the program will print an error message
- You can run the program by `$ python3 202413755_Task2.py`, and see the result in `output.txt`. The file will contain not only the sorted result, but also the runtime measurements for 4 different sorting algorithms.
